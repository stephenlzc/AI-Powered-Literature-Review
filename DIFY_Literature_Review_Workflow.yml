            Reference List: Basic Rules

            This resourse, revised according to the 7th¬†edition APA Publication Manual,
            offers basic guidelines for formatting the reference list at the end of
            a standard APA research paper. Most sources follow fairly straightforward
            rules. However, because¬†sources obtained from academic journals¬†carry
            special weight in research writing, these sources¬†are subject to special
            rules. Thus, this page presents basic guidelines for citing academic journals
            separate from its "ordinary" basic guidelines. This distinction is made
            clear below.

            Note:¬†Because the information on this page pertains to virtually all citations,
            we''ve highlighted one important difference between APA 6 and APA 7¬†with
            an underlined note written in red.¬†For more information, please consult
            the¬†Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, (7th¬†ed.).

            Formatting a Reference List

            Your reference list should appear at the end of your paper. It provides
            the information necessary for a reader to locate and retrieve any source
            you cite in the body of the paper. Each source you cite in the paper must
            appear in your reference list; likewise, each entry in the reference list
            must be cited in your text.

            Your references should begin on a new page separate from the text of the
            essay; label this page "References" in bold, centered at the top of the
            page (do NOT underline or use quotation marks for the title). All text
            should be double-spaced just like the rest of your essay.

            Basic Rules for Most Sources

            All lines after the first line of each entry in your reference list should
            be indented one-half inch from the left margin. This is called hanging
            indentation.

            All authors'' names should be inverted (i.e., last names should be provided
            first).

            Authors'' first and middle names should be written as initials.

            For example, the reference entry for a source written by Jane Marie Smith
            would begin with "Smith, J. M."

            If a middle name isn''t available, just initialize the author''s first
            name: "Smith, J."

            Give the last name and first/middle initials for all authors of a particular
            work up to and including 20 authors (this is a new rule, as APA 6 only
            required the first six authors). Separate each author‚Äôs initials from
            the next author in the list with a comma. Use an ampersand (&) before
            the last author‚Äôs name. If there are 21 or more authors, use an ellipsis
            (but no ampersand) after the 19th author, and then add the final author‚Äôs
            name.

            Reference list entries should be alphabetized by the last name of the
            first author of each work.

            For multiple articles by the same author, or authors listed in the same
            order, list the entries in chronological order, from earliest to most
            recent.

            When referring to the titles of¬†books, chapters, articles, reports, webpages,¬†or
            other sources, capitalize only the first letter of the first word of the
            title and subtitle, the first word after a colon or a dash in the title,
            and proper nouns.

            Note again that the titles of academic journals are subject to special
            rules. See section below.

            Italicize titles of longer works (e.g., books, edited collections, names
            of newspapers, and so on).

            Do not italicize, underline, or put quotes around the titles of shorter
            works such as chapters in books or essays in edited collections.

            Basic Rules for Articles in¬†Academic¬†Journals

            Present journal titles in full.

            Italicize journal titles.

            Maintain any nonstandard punctuation and capitalization that is used by
            the journal in its title.

            For example, you should use¬†PhiloSOPHIA¬†instead of¬†Philosophia,¬†or¬†Past
            & Present¬†instead of¬†Past and Present.

            Capitalize¬†all major words¬†in¬†the¬†titles of journals. Note that this differs
            from the rule for titling other common sources (like books, reports, webpages,
            and so on) described above.

            This distinction is based on the type of source being cited. Academic
            journal titles have all major words capitalized, while other sources''
            titles do not.

            Capitalize¬†the first word of the titles and subtitles¬†of¬†journal articles,
            as well as the¬†first word after a colon or a dash¬†in the title, and¬†any
            proper nouns.

            Do not italicize or underline the article title.

            Do not enclose the article title in quotes.¬†

            So, for example, if you need to cite an article titled "Deep Blue: The
            Mysteries of the Marianas Trench" that was published in the journal¬†Oceanographic
            Study: A Peer-Reviewed Publication,¬†you would write the article title
            as follows:

            Deep blue: The mysteries of the Marianas Trench.

            ...but you would write the journal title as follows:

            Oceanographic Study: A Peer-Reviewed Publication

            Please note:¬†While the APA manual provides examples of how to cite common
            types of sources, it does not cover all conceivable sources. If you must
            cite a source that APA does not address, the APA suggests finding an example
            that is similar to your source and using that format. For more information,
            see page 282 of the¬†Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association,
            7th¬†ed.

            Reference List: Author/Authors

            The following rules for handling works by a single author or multiple
            authors apply to all APA-style references in your reference list, regardless
            of the type of work (book, article, electronic resource, etc.).

            Note:¬†Because the information on this page pertains to virtually all citations,
            we''ve highlighted a few important differences between APA 6 and APA 7¬†with
            underlined notes written in red.

            Single Author

            Last name first, followed by author initials.

            Ahmed, S. (2012).¬†On being included: Racism and diversity in institutional
            life. Duke University Press.

            Two Authors

            List by their last names and initials. Separate author names with a comma.
            Use the ampersand instead of "and."

            Soto, C. J., & John, O. P. (2017). The next big five inventory (BFI-2):
            Developing and assessing a hierarchical model with 15 facets to enhance

            Social Psychology,¬†113(1), 117-143.¬†http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/pspp0000096

            Three to Twenty Authors

            List by last names and initials; commas separate author names, while the
            last author name is preceded again by ampersand.¬†This is a departure from
            APA 6, which only required listing the first six authors before an ellipsis
            and the final author''s name.

            Social Psychology, 117(5), 879-899.¬†http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/pspa0000166

            More Than Twenty Authors

            List by last names and initials; commas separate author names. After the
            first 19 authors‚Äô names, use an ellipsis in place of the remaining author
            names. Then, end with the final author''s name (do not place an ampersand
            before it). There should be no more than twenty names in the citation
            in total.

            Group Author

            Group authors can include corporations, government agencies, organizations,
            etc; and a group may publish in coordination with individuals. Here, you
            simply treat the publishing organization the same way you''d treat the
            author''s name and format the rest of the citation as normal. Be sure
            to give the full name of the group author in your reference list, although
            abbreviations may be used in your text.

            Entries in reference works (¬†e.g. dictionaries, thesauruses, and encyclopedias)
            without credited authors are also considered works with group authors.

            Merriam-Webster. (2008). Braggadocio. In¬†Merriam-Webster‚Äôs Advanced Learner‚Äôs
            English Dictionary. Merriam-Webster.

            When a work has multiple layers of group authorship (e.g. The Office of
            the Historian, which is a part of the Department of State, publishes something),
            list the most specific agency as the author and the parent agency as the
            publisher.

            of State.¬†https://www.state.gov/u-s-contributions-to-international-organizations/

            Unknown Author

            When the work does not have an author move the title of the work to the
            beginning of the references and follow with the date of publication. Only
            use ‚ÄúAnonymous¬†‚Äù if the author is the work is signed ‚ÄúAnonymous.‚Äù¬†This
            is a new addition to APA 7.

            NOTE: When your essay includes parenthetical citations of sources with
            no author named, use a shortened version of the source''s title instead
            of an author''s name. Use quotation marks and italics as appropriate.
            For example, parenthetical citations of the source above would appear
            as follows: (Merriam-Webster''s, 2003).

            Two or More Works by the Same Author

            Use the author''s name for all entries and list the entries by the year
            (earliest comes first). List references with no dates before references
            with dates.

            Urcuioli, P. J. (2011).¬†

            Urcuioli, P. J.¬† (2015).

            When an author appears both as a sole author and, in another citation,
            as the first author of a group, list the one-author entries first.

            Press.

            References that have the same first author and different second and/or
            third authors are arranged alphabetically by the last name of the second
            author, or the last name of the third if the first and second authors
            are the same.

            relationships.¬†Social Psychological and Personality Science, 5(4), 398-405.

            Two or More Works by the Same Author in the Same Year

            If you are using more than one reference by the same author‚Äîor the same
            group of authors listed in the same order‚Äîpublished in the same year,
            first check to see if they have more specific dates¬†(this recommendation
            is new to APA 7). Works with only a year should be listed before those
            with a more specific date. List specific dates chronologically.¬† If two
            works have the same publication date, organize them in the reference list
            alphabetically by the title of the article or chapter. If references with
            the same date are identified as parts of a series (e.g. Part 1 and Part
            2), list them in order of their place in the series. Then assign letter
            suffixes to the year. Refer to these sources in your essay as they appear
            in your reference list, e.g.: "Berndt (2004a) makes similar claims..."

            Introductions, Prefaces, Forewords, and Afterwords

            Cite the publishing information about a book as usual, but cite Introduction,
            Preface, Foreword, or Afterword (whatever title is applicable) as the
            chapter of the book.
